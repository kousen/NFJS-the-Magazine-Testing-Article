Source code for the article "Mocks and Stubs in Groovy Tests" in
the December, 2011 issue of NFJS the Magazine.

If you have gradle installed, just run
gradle build
to build the project and run all the tests.

Otherwise, use "gradlew build", which will first download and
install gradle, then do the build.

In either case, test output is contained in
build/reports/tests/index.html .

Please send any feedback, questions, comments, or good jokes to
